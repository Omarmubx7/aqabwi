1. COMPLETE KICKOFF PROMPT (COPY & PASTE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Act as an expert Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Specialist and Next.js Developer.
I need a high-performance landing page designed to convert traffic into leads (Bookings or Inquiries) for a professional Photographer, Videographer, and Video Editor.

# Project Specs
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Components**: Shadcn/ui (Button, Accordion, Input, Sheet)
- Framer Motion for smooth animations and scroll-triggered effects
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod Validation
- **Email**: Resend (API) for lead notifications
- **Icons**: Lucide React

# Page Structure (AIDA Model)
1. **Sticky Header**: Logo + Primary CTA Button ('Book Now' or 'Get Quote').
2. **Hero Section**: 
   - H1: Captivating hook like 'Capture Your Moments in Stunning Detail'.
   - P: Value proposition highlighting photography, videography, and editing expertise.
   - Visual: High-quality hero image/video reel or parallax gallery on the right.
   - CTA: Large button + 'No obligation quote' microcopy.
3. **Portfolio Gallery**: Image/video carousel or masonry grid showcasing best work, categorized by photography, videography, editing.
4. **Services/Benefits**: 3-4 cards with icons for Photography Shoots, Video Production, Professional Editing, etc.
5. **Social Proof**: 'Trusted by' client logos, stats (e.g., 500+ projects), testimonials carousel.
6. **FAQ**: Accordion for common questions like pricing, turnaround time.
7. **Final CTA**: Simple inquiry form to book a session.

# Functional Requirements
1. **Speed**: Use `next/font` and strictly optimized images/videos. No CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).
2. **Animations**: Framer Motion for hero parallax, gallery hover effects, scroll reveals on sections.
3. **Form**: On submit, send email via Resend and show success toast.
4. **Tracking**: Create a `Link` wrapper or `Button` wrapper that fires a 'conversion' event to console (placeholder for GA4).

# File Structure Preference
- `src/app/page.tsx` (Landing Page layout)
- `src/components/sections/hero.tsx`
- `src/components/sections/portfolio.tsx`
- `src/components/sections/services.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/cta-button.tsx` (Standardized CTA style)
- `src/actions/contact.ts` (Server action for form)

Please start by scaffolding the page structure based on this outline."
